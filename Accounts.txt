The "bank" project has a branch for working with backend mock and a branch for working with a the "RESTful-API" project as a
fully funcitonal backend.

The ChatClient app uses the ChatAPI for storing the messages and the SecuringAngularApps.API/SecuringAngularApps.STS project
for authentications.

The securing-angular-client app uses the SecuringAngularApps.API/SecuringAngularApps.API for the REST services and
SecuringAngularApps.API/SecuringAngularApps.STS for the authentication.

The BethanysPieShop, ChatAPI, RazorPagesMovie, SecuringAngularApps.API and SecuringAngularApps.STS projects need to have their
databases created with the Update-Database command in the Visual Studio Package Manager Console and accounts need to be created
via the create account/register functionality of the particular project.
